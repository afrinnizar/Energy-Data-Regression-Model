# Energy Efficiency Regression

This project uses the **Energy Efficiency dataset** from the [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/242/energy+efficiency) to build and evaluate regression models that predict **Heating Load (Y1)** and **Cooling Load (Y2)** of buildings.

---

## Dataset

* **Features:** Compactness, Surface Area, Wall Area, Roof Area, Height, Orientation, Glazing Area, Distribution
* **Targets:** Heating Load, Cooling Load

---

## Workflow

1. Data preprocessing (cleaning & scaling)
2. Exploratory analysis (feature correlations, plots)
3. Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
4. Evaluation: MAE, RMSE, R¬≤

---

## Results

* **Linear Regression:** baseline performance
* **Decision Tree & Support Vector Regressor:** best accuracy for both Y1 and Y2



## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Do you want me to make it even **shorter (one-page summary)** or keep this medium-sized version?
